      <h2>Lesson</h2>
      <p>God wants you to know who you are in Him. By studying Scripture, you can discover your identity as His child and experience freedom from fear, doubt, and sin. Take time to explore the context of passages, note repeated themes, and cross-reference verses that speak to your life.</p>
      <p>Engaging deeply with Scripture strengthens your mind and spirit. Ask questions, highlight words, and make notes. Using study tools, such as commentaries, devotionals, or your course apps, can help you understand God’s message more fully.</p>
