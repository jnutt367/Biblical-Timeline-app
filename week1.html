      <h2>Lesson</h2>
      <p>The Bible is God’s living Word, active and powerful (Hebrews 4:12). It is not just a book of rules or stories — it is God speaking to you personally. Scripture lights your path (Psalm 119:105) and guides your thoughts, actions, and decisions.</p>
      <p>Reading the Bible daily helps you know God, understand His will, and grow spiritually. Begin simply: read a few verses, reflect on them, and ask God to reveal His truth. Journaling your thoughts can deepen your understanding and help you remember what God has spoken.</p>

      <div class="reflection-box">
        <div class="scripture-badge">Read: Psalm 119:105</div>
        <p class="small">Tip: Read slowly — one verse at a time. Ask God for one thing He wants you to remember today.</p>
