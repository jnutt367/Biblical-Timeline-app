### Why a Christian-friendly MIT license?

I use the MIT license for its simplicity, permissiveness, and legal clarity — it lets others freely use,
modify, and share the project while protecting the author from liability. The short Christian preamble
included in the `LICENSE` file does not alter the legal terms; it simply states the spiritual purpose
behind the code and asks that the acknowledgment of Jesus Christ remain with redistributed copies.
This keeps the project open, ministry-minded, and legally sound.
